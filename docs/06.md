# Conclusions

- Not mature enough❗️
  - Still many unstable features
- Tooling options are quite nice
  - Std library
  - Integrated `deno test` and `deno compile`
  - Velociraptor / TRex / Denon
  - Oak
- Closer to Browser API (with Caveats)
  - Hard to mock DOM. Unsuited to test FED and Shared Modules
